Temporal profile of relativistically underdense plasmas

Inspect intensity of RESE emission as a function of time in the backwards direction:
-For all negative x components
-For 2*pi/10 angular range (centred along laser beam axis (towards source)) 
-For 2*pi/100 angular range (same direction as above)

The issue with these plots is that MATLAB was unable to process the large data sets I was handing it for the higher intensities - so the code printed a tiny fraction of the window and stopped each time.

Nothing particularly interesting here.
